What is the MNE Study Template?
===============================

**The MNE Study Template is a full-flegded processing pipeline for your MEG and
EEG data.**

It operates on raw data stored according to the Brain Imaging Data
Structure (BIDS). Processing is controlled using a simple human-readable
configuration file.

    - preprocessing (filtering, artifact rejection)
    - epoching
    - generation of evoked responses
    - contrasting of experimental conditions
    - time-frequency analysis
    - source estimation

    All intermediate results are saved to disk for later
    inspection, and an **extensive report** is generated.

    Analyses are conducted on individual (per-subject) as well as group level.
