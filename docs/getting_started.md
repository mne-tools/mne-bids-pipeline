1. Inspect your dataset
-----------------------
The Study Template **only** works with BIDS-formatted raw data. To find out
more about BIDS and how to convert your data to the BIDS format, please see
[the documentation of MNE-BIDS](https://mne.tools/mne-bids/stable/index.html).

It is of great importance that

- the BIDS data are anonymized if you require anonymization,
    as the Study Template does not allow you to anonymize data.

    *This was a conscious design decision, not a technical
    limitation *per se*. If you think this decision should be
    reconsidered, please get in touch with the developers.*

- faulty channels are marked as "bad" in the BIDS dataset.
    While we *do* run automated bad channel detection in the
    Study Template, it is considered good practice to flag
    obviously problematic channels as such in the BIDS dataset.

2. Adjust the configuration file
--------------------------------
The Study Template ships with a default configuration file, `config.py`.
You need to create a copy of that configuration file and adjust all parameters
that are relevant to your data processing and analysis.

???+ info
    You should only need to touch the configuration file. None of the scripts
    should be edited.

3. Run the Study Template
-------------------------
Run the full Study Template by invoking
```shell
python run.py process --steps=all --config=/path/to/your/custom_config.py
```
To only run the sensor-level, source-level, or report-generating steps, run:
```shell
python run.py process --steps=sensor --config=/path/to/your/custom_config.py  # sensor-level
python run.py process --steps=source --config=/path/to/your/custom_config.py  # source-level
python run.py process --steps=report --config=/path/to/your/custom_config.py  # generate Reports
```
