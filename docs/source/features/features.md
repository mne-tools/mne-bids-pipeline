What the MNE-BIDS-Pipeline can do
=================================
    
- preprocessing (filtering, artifact rejection)
- epoching
- generation of evoked responses
- contrasting of experimental conditions
- time-frequency analysis
- source estimation

All intermediate results are saved to disk for later
inspection, and an **extensive report** is generated.

Analyses are conducted on individual (per-subject) as well as group level.
