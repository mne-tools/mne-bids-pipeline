## v1.9.0

### :new: New features & enhancements

- Added number of subjects to `sub-average` report (#902, #910 by @SophieHerbst)
- The type annotations in the default configuration file are now easier to read: We
  replaced `Union[X, Y]` with `X | Y` and `Optional[X]` with `X | None`. (#908, #911 by @hoechenberger)
- Added a new configuration option [`spatial_filter_raw`][mne_bids_pipeline._config.spatial_filter_raw]
  to control whether to create cleaned raw data via ICA or SSP. Previously, we'd only clean epochs.
  (#840, #926 by @larsoner and @hoechenberger)

### :warning: Behavior changes

- All ICA HTML reports have been consolidated in the standard subject `*_report.html`
  file instead of producing separate files (#899 by @larsoner).
- When using ICA or SSP with resting-state data, we now automatically produce cleaned raw data files. This
  behavior can be controlled via the new [`spatial_filter_raw`][mne_bids_pipeline._config.spatial_filter_raw]
  configuration option. (#840, #926 by @larsoner and @hoechenberger)
- Changed default for [`source_info_path_update`][mne_bids_pipeline._config.source_info_path_update]
  to `None`.  In `_04_make_forward.py`
  and `_05_make_inverse.py`, we retrieve the info from the file from which
  the `noise_cov` is computed (#919 by @SophieHerbst)
- The [`depth`][mne_bids_pipeline._config.depth] parameter doesn't accept `None`
  anymore. Please use `0` instead. (#915 by @hoechenberger)

### :package: Requirements

- We dropped support for Python 3.9. You now need Python 3.10 or newer. (#908 by @hoechenberger)

### :book: Documentation

- We removed the `Execution` section from configuration options documentation and
  replaced it with new, more explicit sections (namely, Caching, Parallelization,
  Logging, and Error handling), and enhanced documentation. (#914 by @hoechenberger, #916 by @SophieHerbst)

### :bug: Bug fixes

- When running the pipeline with [`find_bad_channels_meg`][mne_bids_pipeline._config. find_bad_channels_meg] enabled,
  then disabling it and running the pipeline again, the pipeline would incorrectly still use automatically detected
  bad channels from the first pipeline run. Now, we ensure that the original bad channels would be used and the
  related section is removed from the report in this case. (#902 by @larsoner)
- Fixed group-average decoding statistics were not updated in some cases, even if relevant configuration options had been changed. (#902 by @larsoner)
- Fixed a compatibility bug with joblib 1.4.0

### :medical_symbol: Code health and infrastructure

- Use GitHub's `dependabot` service to automatically keep GitHub Actions up-to-date. (#893 by @hoechenberger)
