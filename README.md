Study analysis template with MNE
================================

First you will need to update the [config.py](config.py) file. This
file is meant to contain study specific parameters:

- `study_path` : path to the directory that contains your data.
- `subjects_dir` : path pointing to the antomical files for all subjects
- `meg_dir` : path pointing to the MEG files for all subjects
- `subjects` : a list of the subject names
- `exclude_subjects` : the list of subjects to exclude from the above
- `study_name` : string defining what the files in your study are named. (e.g. study_name = 's_audvis')
- `set_channel_types` : set channel type of extra channels that were recorded (e.g. EOG, ECG etc.) Example: set type for EEG062 as EOG.
- `rename_channels` : rename channels. Example: rename channel EEG062 to EOG062.
- `bads` : dictionary containing he list of bad channels for each subject
- `h_freq` : the high-frequency cut-off in the lowpass filtering step. Keep it None if no lowpass filtering should be applied.
- `l_freq` : the low-frequency cut-off in the highpass filtering step. Keep it None if no highpass filtering should be applied.
- `ctc` : for maxfiltering, path to the cross talk file on this machine.  
- `cal` : for maxiltering, path to the calibration file on this machine. 
- `mf_reference_run` : specify which run to use for HPI recalibration, all other runs will have head position adjusted to this one.
- `mf_st_duration`: a float that specifies the buffer duration in seconds, default = 10 s, meaning it acts like a 0.1 Hz highpass filter. If None, no temporal spatial filtering is applied during MaxFilter.
- `mf_head_origin`: The origin of the head used for maxwell filtering.
- `resample_sfreq` : a float that specifies at which sampling frequency the data should be resampled. If None then no resampling will be done.
- `decim` : integer that says how much to decimate data at the epochs level. It is typically an alternative to the `resample_sfreq` parameter.
- `reject` : the default rejection limits to make some epochs as bads. This allows to remove strong transient artifacts. **Note**: these numbers tend to vary between subjects.
- `tmin`: float that gives the start time before event of an epoch.
- `tmax` : float that gives the end time after event of an epochs.
- `baseline` : tuple that specifies how to baseline the epochs. If None, then no baseline applied.
- `event_id` : python dictionary that maps events (trigger/marker values) to conditions. E.g. `event_id = {'Auditory/Left': 1, 'Auditory/Right': 2}`
- `runica` : boolean that says if ICA should be used or not.

Advanced:

- `l_trans_bandwidth` : float that specifies the transition bandwidth of the highpass filter. By default it's `'auto'` and uses default mne parameters.
- `h_trans_bandwidth` : float that specifies the transition bandwidth of the lowpass filter. By default it's `'auto'` and uses default mne parameters.
- `N_JOBS` : an integer that specifies how many subjects you want to run in parallel.


Preprocessing steps
-------------------

| Script      | Description                                                |
|:-----------:|:----------------------------------------------------------:|
| [01-frequency_filtering.py](01-frequency_filtering.py) | Read raw data and apply lowpass or/and highpass filtering |
| [02-maxwell_filtering.py](02-maxwell_filtering_sss.py) | Run maxfilter and do lowpass filter at 40 Hz. |
| [03-extract_events.py](03-extract_events.py) | Extract events or annotations or markers from the data and save it to disk. Uses events from stimulus channel STI101. |
| [04-artifact_correction_ica.py](04-artifact_correction_ica.py) | Run Independant Component Analysis (ICA) for artifact correction. |
| [05-artifact_correction_ssp.py](04-artifact_correction_ssp.py) | Run Signal Subspace Projections (SSP) for artifact correction. These are often also referred to as PCA vectors. |
| [05-make_epochs.py](05-make_epochs.py) | Extract epochs. |
| [06-make_evoked.py](06-make_evoked.py) | Extract evoked data for each condition. |

To Do
-------------------
- add visualization options
- description of how to debug/ run script in interactive mode
- work on artifact rejection scripts (04_)
- document the scripts

Getting started
---------------

First, you need to make sure you have mne-python installed and working on your system. See [installation instructions](http://martinos.org/mne/stable/install_mne_python.html) and once is done you should be able to run in a terminal this:

    $ python -c "import mne; mne.sys_info()"

Once you have mne-python installed on your machine you need the analysis script that you'll need to adjust to your need. You can [download](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-study-template/archive/master.zip) the current version of these script, or get them through git:

	$ git clone https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-study-template.git

For source analysis you'll also need freesurfer, follow the instructions on [their website](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).
