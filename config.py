to pass a dictionary whose **keys** are the name of the new bipolar channel you
wish to create, and whose **values** are tuples consisting of two strings: the

# BREAK DETECTION
# ---------------

find_breaks: bool = False
"""
During an experimental run, the recording might be interrupted by breaks of
various durations, e.g. to allow the participant to stretch, blink, and swallow
freely. During these periods, large-scale artifacts are often picked up by the
recording system. These artifacts can impair certain stages of processing, e.g.
the peak-detection algorithms we use to find EOG and ECG activity. In some
cases, even the bad channel detection algorithms might not function optimally.
It is therefore advisable to mark such break periods for exclusion at early
processing stages.

If `True`, try to mark breaks by finding segments of the data where no
exprimental events have occurred. This will then add annotations with the
description `BAD_break` to the continuous data, causing these segments to be
ignored in all following processing steps.

Once a break of at least [`min_break_duration`][config.min_break_duration]

unnecessarily discard brain activity immediately following that event.

This parameter controls how much time (in seconds) should pass after the last
pre-break event before we start annotating the following segment of the break
period as bad.

To perform source-level analyses, the Pipeline needs to generate a

space to MRI space, and vice versa. This process, called "coregistration",
requires access to both, the electrophyisiological recordings as well as
T1-weighted MRI images of the same participant. If both are stored within
the same session, the Pipeline (or, more specifically, MNE-BIDS) can find the
respective files automatically.

However, in certain situations, this is not possible. Examples include:

- MRI was conducted during a different session than the electrophysiological
  recording.
- MRI was conducted in a single session, while electrophysiological recordings
  spanned across several sessions.
- MRI and electrophysiological data are stored in separate BIDS datasets to
  allow easier storage and distribution in certain situations.

To allow the Pipeline to find the correct MRI images and perform coregistration
automatically, we provide a "hook" that allows you to provide in a custom
function whose output tells the Pipeline where to find the T1-weighted image.

The function is expected to accept a single parameter. The Pipeline will pass
a `BIDSPath` with the following parameters set based on the currently processed
electrophysiological data:

- the subject ID, `BIDSPath.subject`
- the experimental session, `BIDSPath.session`
- the BIDS root, `BIDSPath.root`

This `BIDSPath` can then be modified – or an entirely new `BIDSPath` can be
generated – and returned by the function, pointing to the T1-weighted image.

Note: Note
    The function accepts and returns a single `BIDSPath`.
