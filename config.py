Spatiotemporal SSS acts as implicitly as a high-pass filter where the

buffers are generally better as long as your system can handle the
higher memory usage. To ensure that each window is processed
identically, choose a buffer length that divides evenly into your data.
Any data at the trailing edge that doesn't fit evenly into a whole

The cutoff frequency of the high-pass filter to apply before running ICA.

Set to ``None`` to not apply an additional high-pass filter.

Note: Note

    The Pipeline will only allow you to perform ICA on data that has been

Maximum number of iterations to decompose the data into independent

convergence, pick a high number here (e.g. 3000); yet the algorithm will
terminate as soon as it determines that is has successfully converged, and
not necessarily exhaust the maximum number of iterations. Note that the
default of 200 seems to be sufficient for Picard in many datasets, because
it converges quicker than the other algorithms; but e.g. for FastICA, this
limit may be too low to achieve convergence.
"""

ica_n_components: Optional[Union[float, int]] = 0.8
"""
MNE conducts ICA as a sort of a two-step procedure: First, a PCA is run
on the data (trying to exclude zero-valued components in rank-deficient
data); and in the second step, the principal componenets are passed
to the actual ICA. You can select how many of the total principal
components to pass to ICA – it can be all or just a subset. This determines
how many independent components to fit, and can be controlled via this
setting.

If int, specifies the number of principal components that are passed to the
ICA algorithm, which will be the number of independent components to
fit. It must not be greater than the rank of your data (which is typically
the number of channels, but may be less in some cases).

If float between 0 and 1, all principal components with cumulative
explained variance less than the value specified here will be passed to
ICA.

The decimation parameter to compute ICA. If 5 it means

mri_t1_path_generator: Optional[Callable] = None
"""
To perform source-level analyses, the Pipeline needs to generate a
transformation matrix that translates coordinates from MEG and EEG sensor
space to MRI space, and vice versa. This process, called "coregistration",
requires access to both, the electrophyisiological recordings as well as
T1-weighted MRI images of the same participant. If both are stored within
the same session, the Pipeline (or, more specifically, MNE-BIDS) can find the
respective files automatically.

However, in certain situations, this is not possible. Examples include:

- MRI was conducted during a different session than the electrophysiological
  recording.
- MRI was conducted in a single session, while electrophysiological recordings
  spanned across several sessions.
- MRI and electrophysiological data are stored in separate BIDS datasets to
  allow easier storage and distribution in certain situations.

To allow the Pipeline to find the correct MRI images and perform coregistration
automatically, we provide a "hook" that allows you to provide in a custom
function whose output tells the Pipeline where to find the T1-weighted image.

The function is expected to accept a single parameter. The Pipeline will pass
a `BIDSPath` with the following parameters set based on the currently processed
electrophysiological data:

- the subject ID, `BIDSPath.subject`
- the experimental session, `BIDSPath.session`
- the BIDS root, `BIDSPath.root`

This `BIDSPath` can then be modified – or an entirely new `BIDSPath` can be
generated – and returned by the function, pointing to the T1-weighted image.

Note: Note
    The function accepts and returns a single `BIDSPath`.

???+ example "Example"
    The MRI session is different than the electrophysiological session:
    ```python
    def get_t1_from_meeg(bids_path):

    mri_t1_path_generator = get_t1_from_meeg
