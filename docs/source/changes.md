## Changes since April 15, 2021

### New features & enhancements

- The new configuration option [`ica_reject`][config.ica_reject] allows to
  exclude epochs from the ICA fit based on peak-to-peak amplitude.
- An official [project governance](governance.md) structure has officially
  been adopted.
- Drastically reduces memory usage when creating epochs from datasets with
  multiple runs.
  ({{ gh(355) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- Add time-frequency plot to report.
  ({{ gh(367) }} by {{ authors.robluke }})
- Add possibility to exclude runs from the analysis via the new
  [`exclude_runs`][config.exclude_runs] setting.
  ({{ gh(370) }} by {{ authors.crsegerie }})
- We now create high-resolution scalp surfaces for visualization of the
  coregistration in the reports. Existing surfaces can be force-regenerated by
  setting the new [`recreate_scalp_surface`][config.recreate_scalp_surface]
  to `True`.
  ({{ gh(378) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- When not applying Maxwell-filter (i.e., when
  [`use_maxwell_filter`][config.use_maxwell_filter] is set to `False`, e.g.
  when processing EEG data), we skip the initial data import that would
  essentially just copy the input data to the derivatives root without doing
  any processing. Now, in such situations, the Maxwell-filtering step is
  skipped entirely, and we start with frequency filtering right away. This
  speeds up processing by avoiding unncessary disk I/O and can help preserve
  large quantities of storage space for big datasets.
  ({{ gh(378) }} by {{ authors.dengemann }} and {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- Break periods in the continuous data can now be automatically detected and
  annotated as "bad" segments, which will be ignored during subsequent
  processing. This feature is enabled by default and can be switched off via
  the [`find_breaks`][config.find_breaks] setting.
  ({{ gh(386) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- You can now use the FreeSurfer `fsaverage` template MRI for source estimation
  in cases where you don't have participant-specific MR scans available, as is
  often the case in EEG studies. The behavior can be enabled using the new
  configuration option [`use_template_mri`][config.use_template_mri].
  ({{ gh(387) }} by {{ authors.agramfort }} and {{authors.hoechenberger }})

### Behavior changes

- The [`conditions`][config.conditions] setting will now be `None` by default.
  It is a required setting so it will raise an error if left as `None`.
  ({{ gh(348) }} by {{ authors.guiomar }} and {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- Epochs rejection based on peak-to-peak amplitude, as controlled via the
  [`reject`][config.reject] setting, will now take place **after** ICA or SSP.
  In previous versions of the Pipeline, rejection was carried out before ICA
  and SSP. The exclude epochs from ICA fitting, use the new
  [`ica_reject`][config.ica_reject] setting.
- We don't apply SSP by default anymore.
  ({{ gh(315) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- The `use_ssp` and `use_ica` settings have been removed. Please use the new
  [`spatial_filter`][config.spatial_filter] setting instead.
  ({{ gh(315) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- The `allow_maxshield` setting has been removed. The Pipeline now
  automatically ensures that FIFF files of recordings with active
  shielding (MaxShield) can be imported. Later stages of the Pipeline will fail
  if Maxwell filtering of such data is disabled via `use_maxwell_filter=False`.
  ({{ gh(318) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- The overlay plots that show the effects of ICA cleaning are now based on the
  baseline-corrected data to make it easier to spot the differences.
  ({{ gh(320) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- `bids_root` and `deriv_root` are now converted to absolute paths to avoid
  running into issues caused by relative path specifications.
  ({{ gh(322) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- Warn if using ICA and no EOG- or ECG-related ICs were detected.
  ({{ gh(351) }} by {{ authors.crsegerie }})
- Added the possibility to have different runs for different subjects.
  ({{ gh(353) }} by {{ authors.crsegerie }}))
- Check that the baseline interval falls into `[epochs_tmin, epochs_tmax]`.
  ({{ gh(361) }} by {{ authors.crsegerie }})
- `config.crop` has been renamed to the more explicit
  [`config.crop_runs`][config.crop_runs], as it only applies to individual
  runs and not the concatenated data.
  ({{ gh(358) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- [`ica_reject`][config.ica_reject] now also applies to ECG and EOG epochs.
  ({{ gh(373) }} by {{ authors.crsegerie }})

### Code health

- Each processing script now extracts the required subset of configuration
  options from the user config and operates solely on these. This helps make it
  clear which settings an individual script depends on.
  ({{ gh(383) }} by {{ authors.agramfort }} and {{ authors.hoechenberger }})

### Bug fixes

- The FreeSurfer script could only be run if `--n_jobs` was passed explicitly
  ({{ gh(287) }} by {{ authors.MerlinDumeur }})
- Fix a problem with the FreeSurfer processing step that caused the error
  message `Could not consume arg` after completion ({{ gh(301) }} by
  {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- Selecting the `extended_infomax` ICA algorithm caused a crash
  ({{ gh(308) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- Correctly handle `eog_channels = None` setting after creation of bipolar EEG
  channels
  ({{ gh(311) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- Added instructions on how to handle `FileNotFoundError` when loading the BEM
  model in the source steps ({{ gh(304) }}  by {{ authors.MerlinDumeur }})
- When using [`find_noisy_channels_meg`][config.find_noisy_channels_meg] or
  [`find_flat_channels_meg`][config.find_flat_channels_meg], we now pass
  [`mf_head_origin`][config.mf_head_origin] to the respective bad channel
  detection algorithm to achieve better performance
  ({{ gh(319) }} by {{ authors.agramfort }})
- Baseline was not applied to epochs if neither ICA nor SSP was used
  ({{ gh(319) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- Ensure we always use the cleaned epochs for constructing evoked data
  ({{ gh(319) }} by {{ authors.agramfort }})
- The summary report didn't use the cleaned epochs for showing the effects of
  ICA.
  ({{ gh(320) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- The sanity check comparing the rank of the experimental data and the rank of
   the empty-room after Maxwell-filtering did not use the maxfiltered data.
  ({{ gh(336) }} by {{ authors.agramfort }}, {{ authors.hoechenberger }},
  and {{ authors.crsegerie }})
- `epochs_tmin` and `epochs_tmax` were named incorrectly in some test config
  files.
  ({{ gh(340) }} by {{ authors.crsegerie }})
- We now reject bad epochs by using [`ica_reject`][config.ica_reject] before 
  producing the "overlay" plots that show the evoked data before and after 
  ICA cleaning in the `proc-ica_report`.
  ({{ gh(385) }} by {{ authors.crsegerie }}).
- Passing subject, session, task, and run names to `run.py` the consist only of
  numbers doesn't throw an exception anymore, even if the values weren't
  double-quoted and hence converted to strings by the command-line interface
  toolkit we are using, Fire.
  ({{ gh(375) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- Setting [`eeg_reference`][config.eeg_reference] to a string (name of the
  reference channel) caused us to crash.
  ({{ gh(391) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
