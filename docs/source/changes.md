## Changes since April 15, 2021

### New features & enhancements

- The new configuration option [`ica_reject`][config.ica_reject] allows to
  exclude epochs from the ICA fit based on peak-to-peak amplitude.

### Behavior changes

- Epochs rejection based on peak-to-peak amplitude, as controlled via the
  [`reject`][config.reject] setting, will now take place **after** ICA or SSP.
  In previous versions of the Pipeline, rejection was carried out before ICA
  and SSP. The exclude epochs from ICA fitting, use the new
  [`ica_reject`][config.ica_reject] setting.

### Bug fixes

- The FreeSurfer script could only be run if `--n_jobs` was passed explicitly
  ({{ gh(287) }} by {{ authors.MerlinDemeur }})
- Fix a problem with the FreeSurfer processing step that caused the error
  message `Could not consume arg` after completion ({{ gh(301) }} by
  {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
- Selecting the `extended_infomax` ICA algorithm caused a crash
  ({{ gh(308) }} by {{ authors.hoechenberger }})
