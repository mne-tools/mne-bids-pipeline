* :blue_book: Extensive processing and analysis summary reports.
* :people_holding_hands_tone1: Process just a single participant, or as many as several hundreds of participants â€“ in parallel.
* :computer: Execution via an easy-to-use command-line utility.
* :sos: Helpful error messages in case something goes wrong.
* :footprints: Data processing as a sequence of standard processing steps.
* :fast_forward: Steps are cached to avoid unnecessary recomputation.
* :eject: Data can be "ejected" from the pipeline at any stage. No lock-in!
